  A simple book finder
</p>

## Getting started

This project was inspired by the [APP IDEAS repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Book-Finder-App.md), in which one of the projects is a Book Finder. And to develop this web page I decided to use React.js and the Google Books API.

### Introduction

Many people look for books to read or buy, but sometimes forget the name of the book, but remember the author or editor who published the book, thinking about it, I decided to develop Booksure, a website made in React that consumes the Google books API, making it easier for people to search for books.
Search for books anywhere, you don't need to know the name of the book, if you know the name of the author or the publisher, just type and search
